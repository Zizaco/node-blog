**This is my first glimpse at Node.js**

A basic blog application built for study purposes using:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Jade
- Mongoose
- Mocha
- Expect.js
- Everyauth

*PS: Everything was done from scratch (without "generators") while studying node.js. So don't expect beautiful code. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯*
